tdVisualFactoryPlugin
=====================

Provides funcionalities for uploading pictures into separate albums using
additional features, such as configurable multiple sizes, watermarks, etc.

This plugin is a part of __TD CMF__ and is based on __Doctrine ORM__.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository by executing the following
command from the project root directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/tdVisualFactoryPlugin/trunk plugins/tdVisualFactoryPlugin

or by using the default symfony plugin install command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install tdVisualFactoryPlugin

Usage
=====

  * You shall redefine the configuration __td_visual_factory_sizes__ array and
    define custom sizes of uploaded images. Each uploaded image will be stored
    in the original format and all defined custom sizes.

  * After defining custom image sizes, you shall create directories storing
    those specific size images (in the default upload directory, which is
    __uploads/td/images/__ and make sure those directories have permissions to
    write new files in.

  * The first of all custom image sizes is used as the thumbnail size in admin
    generator (image album editing with image list).

Configuration
=============

You can modify settings of the tdVisualFactoryPlugin in the
__config/tdVisualFactoryPluginConfiguration.class.php__ file:

  * _td_visual_factory_watermark_dir_ - (String) upload dir of all watermark
    images,

  * _td_visual_factory_image_dir_ - (String) upload dir of all images,

  * _td_visual_factory_sizes_ - (Array) all image sizes (not counting
    the original uploaded file),

  * _td_visual_factory_watermark_sizes_ - (Array) all image sizes (they have to
    be included in the _td_visual_factory_sizes_ array) that shall be
    watermarked,

  * _td_visual_factory_watermark_prefix_ - (String) prefix for intermediate
    watermarked image creation files. By default it's 'tmp-', so if the file
    1ba05c.jpg represents resized and watermarked image, then tmp-1ba05c.jpg is
    the same image: after resizing, but before putting the watermark on it,

  * _td_visual_factory_size_thumbnail_ - (String) the size used on the frontend
    within lightbox widget - as the thumbnail,

  * _td_visual_factory_size_full_ - (String) the size used on the frontend
    within lightbox widget - as the zoomed, full size image,

  * _td_visual_factory_mode_ - (String) external library use within the Visual
    Factory, can be either _gd_ (GD) or _im_ (Imagick).

  * To use the activate/deactivate AJAX interface in the backend td_image_album
    module, remember to enable the __graphics__ module of the __tdCorePlugin__
    inside your settings.yml file (see tdCorePlugin README).
